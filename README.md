Retirement calculator

I built this for fun as a vanilla JS coding project because recruiters kept asking me if I had a portfolio site.

To run, download the repo.
One the command line, from the `/server` directory, type `node server.js`
Open the browser once the log shows the listener is running on the right port.

Enter your data and click the buttons.



TODOs:
* Split out the JS from the HTML file.
* Add some styling
* Add something about the future retirement age and bump up the calculations.
* Add in the calculations for present value of dollars vs future value
* Add in some calculations for Social Security income
